Overview
</h2>
    <table align="center" width="95%" id="info">

    <td>
One significant "improvement" over the simple plastic puzzles is that this applet can solve
itself automatically. The <span id="emphasis">run</span> method in the applet class periodically
calls <span id="emphasis">nextAutoMove</span>. If automatic solving is operating, the automated
solution class builds and sends a request to move the next tile.
The request is handled in the <span id="emphasis">puzzleChange</span> method
which calls <span id="emphasis">moveTile</span> to take care of the move.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
The tricky stuff is in deciding which tile to move : this is the job
of the <a href="PuzzleSolution.java">PuzzleSolution</a> class and its offspring.
The overall strategy is to start at the top left and move right along the
row, then down to the next row (left to right) and on down. The last two
rows are treated differently : they are solved a column at a time, upper
tile first. This solving order is mirrored in the <span id="emphasis">getLowestUnsolvedValue</span>
method in AutoData. In practice, it is that method which is used to determine
the next tile to solve.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
An exception to this order has effect when there are only two columns.
In that case, a similar solution to the last two rows applies but rotated through ninety degrees.
The tiles are solved a row at a time but with a special move for the rightmost column (<span id="emphasis">SolveRightColumn</span>).

Class hierarchy</h2>
    <table align="center" width="95%" id="info">
    <tr>
    <td>
Solving the puzzle consists of many tile moves - too many for me to grasp
individually. So there are classes which support multiple moves. The base
class for these is <span id="emphasis">PuzzleMove</span>. This supports moving tiles in stages
to a target position around a reference position. The reference position
is calculated implicitly when the class is initialised, but some situations
require that it is set explicitily to modify the behaviour of the class.
<p>When building the solution, I found it easier to imagine "moving" the
blank rather than moving the tiles. Hence, there are several classes which
clearly move the blank regardless of the tiles being moved - <span id="emphasis">MoveBlankTo</span>,
<span id="emphasis">MoveBlankRightTo</span>,
<span id="emphasis">MoveBlankLeftTo</span>,
<span id="emphasis">MoveBlankUpTo</span>,
<span id="emphasis">MoveBlankDownTo</span>, <span id="emphasis">RotateBlankTo</span> and
<span id="emphasis">AntiRotateBlankTo</span>. Along with the basic <span id="emphasis">MoveTile</span>, these classes
form the building blocks for moving a tile to its target (solved) position.
<p>The next step is building classes to deal with various situations. The
major situations (and classes to deal with them) are
<ul>
<li>
last row (<span id="emphasis">SolveLastRow</span>)- to "solve" the tile in the bottom row we
generally need to disturb the solved tile above it;
</li>
<li>
last column (<span id="emphasis">SolveLastColumn</span>) - to "solve" the tile in the rightmost
column we generally need to disturb the two solved tiles to the left of
its target position;
</li>
<li>
right column of two (<span id="emphasis">SolveRightColumn</span>) - to "solve" the tile in the rightmost
column we disturb the solved tiles to the left of its target position;
</li>
<li>
tile to the left of its target position (<span id="emphasis">SolveFromLeft</span>) - must move
tile to the right without disturbing the solved tiles to the left of its
target position;
</li>
<li>
normal situation (<span id="emphasis">SolveNormal</span>) - none of the above ( target position
to the left or above or both ).
</li>
</ul>
Of course, within each situation there are smaller complications. Usually,
these involve initially positioning the blank next to the solving tile.
<p>To complete the solution, there are the <span id="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> and <span id="emphasis">SolveTilePuzzle</span>
classes. The <span id="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> class puts the previous classes together
to move an individual tile to its target position. The <span id="emphasis">SolveTilePuzzle</span>
class creates <span id="emphasis">SolveTileValue</span> classes for each tile until all the
entire puzzle has been solved.

Class methods</h2>
    <table align="center" width="95%" id="info">
    <tr>
    <td>
One of the key features of the solution/move classes is the ability to
be driven from a timer, which requires persistence of information.
<ul>
<li>
So, the position of all tile in the puzzle must be available to the solution(<span id="emphasis">setData</span>
and <span id="emphasis">getData</span>).</li>

<li>
The tiles to be moved for the solution must be obtained one at a time (<span id="emphasis">getTileToMove</span>).
</li>

<li>
It must be possible to identify when all of the tiles have been obtained(<span id="emphasis">isComplete</span>).
</li>

<li>
Clearly, it must also be possible to specify the objective of the move(<span id="emphasis">setTargetPosition</span>
and <span id="emphasis">setTargetValue</span>).
</li>

<li>
In more complex classes, there are methods to move to the next stage in
the solution (<span id="emphasis">nextStage</span>) and to specify a reference position which will modify the
"route" of the solution(<span id="emphasis">setReferencePosition</span>).
</li>

<li>
Last, we need a method to figure out the next step in the move(<span id="emphasis">calculateNextMove</span>).
</li>
</ul>

other blank move classes.</td>

it reaches the target position. This should only be used if the target
is to the right of, and in the same row as, the blank.</td>
