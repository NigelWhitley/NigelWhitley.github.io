<div class="program-text">
<p>A Javascript aid for solving the logic puzzle known as Sudoku.The sidebar for it contains more information including a simple guide to using it</p>

<div class="program-text">
<p>A PHP program using AJAX which displays duplicate files according to a supplied xml file.</p>
<p>This was written because my digital camera used to reset itself and I was never sure which photos had been uploaded. Not widely useful but it was easier to use than comparing them manually (and let me play around with xml).</p>
<p>I've put it on here because someone may want an example of xml processing in PHP.</p>

<div class="program-text">
<p>A simple gallery and slideshow using jQuery and Colourbox.</p>
<p>This was largely an exercise in using jQuery and dynamically generated CSS. It allowed me to try integrating an existing Javascript module (Colourbox) but, after getting it working, I wrote a "native" one to see how much code it would need to get something working.</p>

<div class="program-text">
<p>A Nonogram solver using the Codeigniter framework</p>
<p>Written to solve the nonogram for the 2015 GCHQ Christmas card puzzle. It works for other nonograms I've tried too, although the algorithm is far from thorough.</p>
<p>The program uses Ajax with session variables to keep track of the puzzle state.The puzzles must currently be stored as xml files, although I'm working on a graphical editing facility. The Load button will show two puzzles - "gchq" and "umbrella". I've disabled the Save action with it being a public server.</p>

<p>The programs were developed primarily for my own interest and probably won't work well on a tablet or smartphone - or even a low-res screen. I may tweak them at some stage to bring them up-to-date but I'm generally more interested in developing new things than revivification. Otherwise this page might be titled "The Running Dead".</p>
<p>It's rather a mixed bag because I'm usually trying to learn how something works or how to make something work. For example, this page is static HTML and CSS (except for the "Back" menu option, even the button clicks use a CSS hack) but the Sudoku helper is essentially all Javascript (except the sidebar).</p>

<div id="aboutme">
<h3 class="subtitle">About me</h3>
<p>
I started programming in the mid '70s, as part of a Computer Studies 'O' level. 
At first it was coding sheets sent away to be entered into the computer. 
Then the school installed the technological marvel of a teletype, complete with punched tape facility, connected to the <span id="remote-mainframe" title="A modern smartphone would probably outperform that technological titan">remote mainframe</span> through an acoustic coupler. 
I was smitten and knew that writing software was what I wanted as a career.
</p>
<p>
At university, I studied computing science and experienced the limitless joy of having a <span id="titanic-cards" title="It was the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler">heroically large stack of punched cards</span> distribute itself over the machine room floor when a rubber band broke.
More happily, I also used Unix and wrote programs using a screen for the first time. I even bought a Sinclair ZX80 when they appeared and was able to have my very own computer to explore.
</p>
<p>
On graduation, I was fortunate enough to get a job with a major software house and have been developing software ever since. <span id="favourite-language" title="My favourite is awk, simply because it does what it does so neatly">I've used over a dozen languages (commercially) through the years and meandered from assembly language to object-oriented web development. </span>
I've worked on code to bolt together the wings of an Airbus and code to display its flight plan in the cockpit, worked in refineries and environmental agencies, for multinationals and where I was the only employee. 
But I still enjoy writing code at home.
</p>
<p>
I've gone from coding sheets to stylesheets but writing software still <span id="coding-caveat" title="(and occasionally frustrates)">thrills and delights</span>. These programs reflect my curiosity and a tendency to explore new (to me) techniques by writing programs for idle amusement.
