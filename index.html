<h3>
Why have I used the <a href="license.txt">Gnu GPL</a> ?
</h3>
<p>Because it protects those I want to benefit - the users and me :-).
</p>
<p>
It benefits users by guaranteeing their right to see and improve this source code, even if I get a sulk on and change my mind later. Of course, that doesn't mean that you're expected to do anything with the source code. 
Think of the GPL as a fire extinguisher: in an ideal world you'll never need it but better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.
</p>
<p>
It benefits me by allowing me to share the source while preserving my rights - it's still copyrighted, not public domain, so my rights have not been diminished. More particularly, for both the renaming utility and the TilePuzzle, the most interesting part of developing them was figuring out the internal algorithms. Therefore I want people to be able to see the code so that they can see how they work.
